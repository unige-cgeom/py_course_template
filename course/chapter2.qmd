Once happy with how the preview looks, it is time to deploy the course on a webpage that is available to everyone,
not just a local rendering.

We will use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy a web page based on the .qmd files we have created.

First, you need to create a file:

 `.github\workflows\publish.yml`

```yaml

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: main

name: Quarto Publish

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          # Use a stable version supported by most scientific wheels
          python-version: '3.11'
          cache: 'pip'

      # If you keep a requirements.txt in the repo (recommended)
      - name: Install Python dependencies
        run: |
          python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
          if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then
            python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
          else
            # Fallback if no requirements.txt is present
            python3 -m pip install jupyter nbformat ipykernel numpy matplotlib pandas
          fi

      - name: Render and Publish
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: gh-pages
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

```

Second, you need to create a `requirements.txt` at the root of the repository, listing all dependencies required to run
your code snippets.

You then need to initialize the publishing process using the following command:

```bash
quarto publish
```
Select "GitHub Pages" as the provider, and then say "Yes" when asked to publish on the given URL.

The deployment will now start by creating a new branch `gh-pages` by pushing all your material to the URL and you can see it in your browser.

Finally, do not forget to commit your changes to the `main` branch.
